# Superhero-Name-Generator
**Superhero Name Generator** A deep learning project that generates superhero and supervillain names using an LSTM model trained on a dataset of existing names. It uses character-level tokenization, sequence padding, and a neural network with embedding, Conv1D, and LSTM layers to predict the next character and create creative names.
